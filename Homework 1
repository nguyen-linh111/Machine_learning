Homework 1: Machine Learning
Exercise 1
We have:
A: Predict after testing.
B: Given
0: negative
1: positive
P(B = 1) = 0.05 => P(B = 0) = 0.95
P(A=1| B = 1) = 0.98
P(A = 1 | B = 0) = 0.03
P(B = 1 | H = 1)
= [P(A = 1 | B = 1) ∗ P(A = 1)]/(P(B = 1))
= [(0.05) ∗ (0.98)]/[(0.05) ∗ (0.98) + (0.95) ∗ (0.03)]
= 0.623
